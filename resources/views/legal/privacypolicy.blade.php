What is Personal Data

We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.

If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us.

 

 

The following data is collected by or on behalf of HeyHo:

Data provided by users. This includes:
User Profile
We collect data when users create or update their HeyHo accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), driver’s license and other government identification documents (which may indicate document numbers as well as birth date, gender, and photo). This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery persons, emergency contact information, user settings, and evidence of health or fitness to provide services using HeyHo App. This also includes gender and/or occupation (when required for certain

HeyHo services or programs, if applicable). We may use the photos submitted by users to verify their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies.

Background check and identity verification: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery persons. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on HeyHo’s behalf. We also collect identity verification from HeyHo users who request alcohol delivery.
Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.
User content: We collect the information users submit when they contact HeyHo customer support, provide ratings or compliments for other users or restaurant partners, or otherwise contact HeyHo. This may include feedback, photographs or other recordings collected by users.
Data created during use of our services. This includes: 
Location data (driver and delivery person): HeyHo collects this data when the HeyHo app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device.
Location data (riders and delivery recipients). We collect precise or approximate location data from riders’ and delivery recipients’ mobile devices if they enable us to do so. HeyHo collects this data from the time a ride or delivery is requested until it is finished, and any time the app is running in the foreground of their mobile device. We use this data to enhance your use of our apps, including to improve pick-up locations, enable safety features, and prevent and detect fraud. 
HeyHo collects driver location data, and links location data collected during a trip with their rider’s account, even if the rider has not enabled us to collect location data from their device. This enables us to offer services to the rider like receipt generation and customer support. 
Transaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided, order details, delivery information, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance travelled, and payment method. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.
Usage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes data such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and third-party sites or services used before interacting with our services. In some cases, we collect this data through cookies, pixels, tags, and similar tracking technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.
 

Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Site areas accessible only to registered users require that your browser accept Cookies. HeyHo App uses Cookies to verify that you are properly signed in, to display information for your primary location, and to highlight your pending reservations, for example. We may also use Cookies from time to time to measure your response to new aspects of the HeyHo Services and/or emails in an effort to continually improve customer service and HeyHo Services usability. Please be aware that a Cookie cannot spread computer viruses, retrieve any other data from your hard drive, or capture your email address.

You can erase or block Cookies from your computer if you wish to do so (your internet browser help screen or manual will thoroughly explain this process), but certain parts of the HeyHo Services, as well as parts of the Site, may not work correctly or will not work at all if your browser is set not to accept Cookies.

 

Device data: We may collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion data, and mobile network data.
 

Communications data: We enable users to communicate with each other and HeyHo through HeyHo’s mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable drivers and riders, and restaurants or delivery persons and delivery recipients, to call, text, or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, HeyHo receives some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. HeyHo may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our products and services, and for analytics.
 

Rental devices data: We collect data generated by rental devices, such as bicycles, scooters, or other light electric vehicles or devices, when they’re in use. This includes the date and time of use, and the location, route, and distance travelled. To the extent permitted by law, the location data collected from the rental device during the trip will be linked to the renter’s account, even if they have not enabled HeyHo to collect location data from their mobile device.
Audio recordings: In certain jurisdictions, and where permitted by law, users can record the audio of their trips through an in-app feature. Recordings are encrypted and stored on users’ devices, and are only shared with HeyHo if submitted to customer support by the users in connection with safety incidents.
Data from other sources. This includes:
User feedback, such as ratings, feedback, or compliments.
Users participating in our referral programs. For example, when a user refers another person, we receive the referred person’s personal data from that user.
HeyHo account owners who request services for or on behalf of other users, or who enable such users to request or receive services through their accounts. This includes owners of HeyHo for Business accounts.
Users or others providing information in connection with claims or disputes.
HeyHo business partners through which users create or access their HeyHo account, such as payment providers, social media services, or apps or websites that use HeyHo’s APIs or whose APIs HeyHo uses. 
Vendors who help us verify users’ identity, background information, and eligibility to work, for regulatory, safety, and security purposes. 
Insurance, vehicle, or financial services providers for drivers and/or delivery persons.
Partner transportation companies (for drivers or delivery persons who use our services through an account associated with such a company).
